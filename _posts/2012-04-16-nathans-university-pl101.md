For those who don't know, [Nathan's University](http://nathansuniversity.com/) is currently giving a [Programming Languages 101](http://nathansuniversity.com/pl101.html) course. Part of the output of the course is your own language implemented in Javascript and hosted on Google's App Engine. It's only been two weeks so far, but I'm really enjoying the course. 

The first lesson was a quick tour of programming languages. The lesson itself didn't really teach me any languages that I wasn't already familiar with, but the homework was to learn about a language and post a simple example and then an example of something cool in the language. This thread was the heart of the first lessson, since the group surveyed a whole host of languages.

The second lesson introduces Abstract Syntax Trees and some simple source to source translation of a musical language called MUS. The other source in this case was a simpler music language that talks only understands simple notes. The lesson itself was pretty easy, but I think it was a great introduction to walking an AST and transforming it.

I'll probably post about what I'm working on here, but you can also watch my project at [https://github.com/dscleaver/PL101Project](https://github.com/dscleaver/PL101Project).
